Lottie files with After Effects, amazing...

So, besides some of the issues getting the extension to install properly and having no luck loading lottie files into lottiefiles.com from the extension, it did create the lottie json for download and seems to work nicely... 5 second logo animation, only 27Kb... not bad!

For whatever reason... this is not displaying in blog posts via mdx... so I'm gonna get it in another way.
