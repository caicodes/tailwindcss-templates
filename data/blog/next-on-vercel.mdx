# Next on Vercel

This blog is faster in production than when working on it locally... it's simply a blazing final product!

- Super easy, updates to main are built and deployed automatically
- Perfect for always updating live feed of posts for the new blog and open source project initiatives underway!
- Nice break from firebase (which I love for many reasons :)
