## Next.js and Tailwind CSS Deep Dive

Starting a New Project to showcase and organize specific Next.js and Tailwind code snippets, solutions, templates, etc. The particular focus in this project is not as open as this blog as it's going to drill down into specifics for a specific starter tempate repository configuration.

### Launching Soon!

The Next Tailwind UI from Artasce Creative is launching very soon to document and showcase the entire project from inception.
