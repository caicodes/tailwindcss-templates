# Adding Posts Automation

A new post can quickly be created from the command line, a real time saver and customizable. I am enjoying the static site generation tools and with the power of MDX... the ability to drop in real components while letting content be the focus for each new post. Incredibly flexible... fast as lightning on the hosted site at Vercel.

```bash

node ./scripts/compose.js

```

Prompt guided and dropped into the blog main folder.
